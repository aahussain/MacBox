Check firstly if the wireless connection is available with this command:

$ iwlist wlan0 scan
$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

# To display WiFi signal strength in the terminal, you can run this command:
$ watch -n 1 "awk 'NR==3 {print \"WiFi Signal Strength = \" \$3 \"00 %\"}''' /proc/net/wireless"

# This command has also the same function:

$ watch -n 1 cat /proc/net/wireless
